// First i looked at the objdump of the exe file to file the address of the variable garde in memeory. Then I tried to use gdb to confirm the memory address. Then I input a dozen As followed by bunch of %x. I continued adding %x until i saw the value 41 printed on the screen. I knew that if I feed enought %x into the buffer eventually it will print out the values in the buffer. Then I replaced As with the little endian memeory location of the grades and put %n at the end of the streams of %x to make use of a printf vulnerabilty discussed in slides. The first grade I got was s then n and eventually after changing some x to c and other manupulation, i changed the grade to A using printf.

int main() {
	printf("%s",attackString);
	return 0;
