# CS4630-Defense-Against-the-Dark-Arts

This class was one of the most fun class in the CS department. First, we went over basic web vulnerabilities and attacks such as SQL injection and XSS on the OWASP platform. Then, we used Virtual box Linux to look at the “pagedump” of the given binary files to perform the reverse engineering of what is going on on the file. Also used signature-based matching of LEX to create an antivirus engine to detect certain patterns of viruses on given binary files. 
I also performed buffer overflow, format string attacks, Return-Oriented Programming, and Spectre.  


Course Objectives:
1.  Understand the ethical issues surrounding computer security violations.
2.  Understand the nature of software vulnerabilities, how a malicious adversary exploits them,and how to defend against them.
3.  Understand the nature and types of malware (e.g., viruses, worms, spyware, botnets, ransomware, Trojans, etc.) and how they are threats to computer systems.
4.  Understand the nature and types of web-based vulnerabilities and attacks (e.g., SQL injection, code injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery)
5.  Learn the techniques used to prevent, detect, repair, and defend against malware.
6.  Learn to use program binary examination tools to detect malicious code
